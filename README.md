OpenBolt is an open source orchestration tool that automates the manual work it takes to maintain your infrastructure. Use OpenBolt to automate tasks that you perform on an as-needed basis or as part of a greater orchestration workflow. For example, you can use OpenBolt to patch and update systems, troubleshoot servers, deploy applications, or stop and restart services. OpenBolt can be installed on your local workstation and connects directly to remote targets with SSH or WinRM, so you are not required to install any agent software.

OpenBolt is a community implementation of [Puppet Bolt](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt).

### Bring order to the chaos with orchestration

Run simple plans to rid yourself of the headaches of orchestrating complex workflows. Create and share OpenBolt plans to easily expand across your application stack.

### Use what you have to automate simple tasks or complex workflows

Get going with your existing scripts and plans, including YAML, PowerShell, Bash, Python or Ruby, or reuse content from the [Puppet Forge](https://forge.puppet.com).

### Documentation

OpenBolt's documentation can be found under [documentation](./documentation). See also the [Puppet Bolt Docs site](https://help.puppet.com/bolt/current/topics/bolt.htm)

At the time of writing, the OpenVoxProject does not have a documentation website.
